# Skincare Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The **Skincare Recommendation System** is an intelligent solution aimed at providing users with a personalized skincare routine based on both their responses to a series of targeted questions and an image analysis of their skin. 

The system guides users through:
- A set of questions related to their skin type, concerns (e.g., dryness, sensitivity), and lifestyle.
- An option to upload an image of their skin, which is analyzed to detect any visible skin conditions such as acne, redness, or pigmentation.

Based on the collected data, the system generates a customized skincare routine, recommending products that suit the user's skin profile. This combines subjective user input with objective skin condition analysis, offering accurate and holistic skincare advice.

### Role of Business Analyst

As a **Business Analyst**, I contributed to this project by:
- **Identifying business goals**: Ensuring the system improves user satisfaction through personalized recommendations.
- **Gathering and documenting requirements**: Developing user stories that align system functionality with user needs.
- **Stakeholder collaboration**: Working with dermatologists and product experts to validate the recommendations.
- **Visualizing workflows**: Creating use case diagrams and process flows for user interactions and system processes.
- **Defining requirements**: Outlining functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring the system is efficient, secure, and scalable for future growth.

This project demonstrates the value a Business Analyst brings to transforming business objectives into actionable system features while optimizing the user experience.
